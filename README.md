# ACRoBEAR
This is an overview of preliminary investigations of future climate variability in Arctic regions, as a part of Arctic Community Resilience to Boreal Environmental change: Assessing Risks from fire and disease (ACRoBEAR).

Our goal has been to quantify the changes in daily variability in variables such as temperature, precipitation, wind, and soil moisture, as well as more composite variables or these, through the changes in probability density funcitons. The resulting figures can be found in the folder /figures/. Our methods can be found the programs in the folder /scripts/.

For this project, we have considered regions in Alaska, Canada, Fennoscandia, West Siberia and East Siberia. However, we have also applied our methods to other parts of the world. The latitude and longitude values of the regions we have used can be found in the program /scripts/calcAreagrid.py
