In this folder you find different figures. 

The folder is divided into /ACRoBEAR/ and /OtherRegions/: one folder for the ACRoBEAR regions (Alaska, Canada, Fennoscandia, West Siberia, East Siberia) and one for the other regions we have looked at.

In addition, we have one folder /GMST/ containing plots of the global annual mean surface temperature of the Earth, which we have calculated for different models and shared socio-economic pathways.

In the /ACRoBEAR/ and /OtherRegions/ folders you find the following folders:
* /allregionspdf/: containing probability density function (PDF) plots for each variable and each season for regions grouped together five and five (from which program?)
* /annualCycles/: containing the folders:
  - /MeanMinMaxCycles/: containing annual cycles for a variable averaged over ensemble members and with minimum and maximum values for two warming levels
  - /PDFCycles/: containing annual cycles of probability density for different values of a variable, with all warming levels grouped together
* /individualPDFs/: containing PDFs for individual regions and variables
* /montlyPDFs/: containing PDFs for individual seasons divided up into months
* /PDFchange/: containing different measures for how the PDF has changed, boht through displacement in overlap area from preindustrial climate (dispment) and changes in mean and standard deviation of the PDF (pdfchange).
* /summaryFigs/: tables of summary figures
